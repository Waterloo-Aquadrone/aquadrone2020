"""
This class is responsible for listening to the motor_command topic where the thrusts for all the thrusters are published
and distributing the individual thrusts to all the individual thrusters' topics. The topic names are used by both Gazebo
and the real thrusters. This node is necessary, because sometimes the ThrustComputer node may be bypassed 
and controls may be directly sent here.
